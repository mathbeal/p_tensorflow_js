# Description

You will learn how to build a simple "teachable machine", a custom image classifier that you will train on the fly in the browser using TensorFlow.js, a powerful and flexible machine learning library for Javascript. You will first load and run a popular pre-trained model called MobileNet for image classification in the browser. You will then use a technique called "transfer learning", which bootstraps our training with the pre-trained MobileNet model and customizes it to train for your application.

This codelab will not go over the theory behind the teachable machine application. If you are curious about that, check out this tutorial.

What you'll learn
- How to load pretrained MobileNet model and make a prediction on new data
- How to make predictions through the webcam
- How to use intermediate activations of MobileNet to do transfer learning on a new set of classes you define on the fly with the webcam
